This is a basic code for Raytracing. 
The first version of the code "naivetracer.cpp" is a very basic implementation of a raytracer taking in traingles, their depths and colors and window size and it outputs the resulting image.
The second version "raytracer.cpp" is a modular OOP code for raytracer with 3-d Vector, Ray, Triangle and Sphere classes with all standard operations and intersection tests. It also takes window size and traingle information and outputs an image based on ray-triangle intersections simulating pin-hole camera model (rays have fixed origin). Further extended this to abstract classes, inheritance and header files and guards.
To compile the code: g++ -Ofast raytracer.cpp -lrt
To run the code: ./a.out < <inputfilename> <outputfilename>

NOTE:
1. For inputs 'ip1' to 'ip5', outputs are 'op1' to 'op5'.
2. For bunny1.pgm to bunny4.pgm information and times are in times_bunny.txt
