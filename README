This is a basic code for Raytracing. 
The first version of the code "naivetracer.cpp" is a very basic implementation of a raytracer taking in traingles, their depths and colors and window size and it outputs the resulting image.
The second version "raytracer.cpp" is a modular OOP code for raytracer with 3-d vector,ray and triangle classes with all standard operations and intersection tests. It also takes window size and traingle information and outputs an image based on ray-triangle intersections simulating pin-hole camera model (rays have fixed origin) . Currently in the process of extending to sphere intersection tests
