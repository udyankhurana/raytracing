This is a basic code for Raytracing in color. 

It is a modular OOP code for raytracer with 3-d Vector, Ray, Triangle and Sphere classes with all standard operations and intersection tests. It also takes window size and traingle information and outputs an image based on ray-triangle intersections simulating pin-hole camera model (rays have fixed origin). Further extended this to abstract classes, inheritance and header files and guards. 

It is complete with lighting and shading models, and also recursive ray-tracing

To compile the code: g++ -Ofast raytracer.cpp -lrt
To run the code: ./a.out <outputfilename> <width> <height>

NOTE: 
1. For out1.ppm and out2.ppm, all objects are
3. Timing Information for all inputs is in time.txt.
